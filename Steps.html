<left><h1>Steps</h1></left> 
<left><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Dig a square hole that is 1 metre on each side. </li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place rounded stones on the bottom <br>(dont put one on top of the other), reserve the dirt. </li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Build a wood fire on top of them.<br> Once it is set, light and allow to burn until the wood turns into charcoal.</li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> There will now be some charcoals <br>and non-burnt woods, so take a spade or a fork and get the wood out. There should only be the heated stones left in the hole.</li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Clean the ingredients for your meal and prepare them for the oven.<br>
    (There are two ways to cook lovo, you can wrap your food,bury it, and then place hot stones on top.<br> Or you can place them on top of palm leaves resting on the hot stones.)</li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 6:</strong>  Place the ingredients that need cooking in a layer of taro leaves, then wrap in aluminum foil.</li></left>
<left><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Cover the banana leaves and palm ferns with the reserved dirt.<br> Cook for 45 minutes ­­­­– 1 hour, then slowly uncover. When the leaves are a nice yellow-brown colour, it is cooked.</li></left>
