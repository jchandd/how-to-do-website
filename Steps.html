<center><li>Step 1: Dig a square hole that is 1 metre on each side. </li></center>
<center><li>Step 2: Place rounded stones on the bottom (dont put one on top of the other), reserve the dirt. </li></center>
<center><li>Step 3: Build a wood fire on top of them. Once it is set, light and allow to burn until the wood turns into charcoal.</li></center>
<center><li>Step 4: There will now be some charcoals and non-burnt woods, so take a spade or a fork and get the wood out. There should only be the heated stones left in the hole.</li></center>
<center><li>Step 5: Clean the ingredients for your meal and prepare them for the oven.<br>
    (There are two ways to cook lovo, you can wrap your food,bury it, and then place hot stones on top. Or you can place them on top of palm leaves resting on the hot stones.)</li></center>
<center><li>Step 6: Place the ingredients that need cooking in a layer of taro leaves, then wrap in aluminum foil.</li></center>
<center><li>Step 7: Cover the banana leaves and palm ferns with the reserved dirt. Cook for 45 minutes ­­­­– 1 hour, then slowly uncover. When the leaves are a nice yellow-brown colour, it is cooked.</li></center>
